# Iris flower classification model
The goal of this project was to learn more about classfication by using a machine learning model that predicts the type of the iris flower based on 4 measurements (input), the model acheived a 97% accuracy based on the dataset i used, this percetage can be improved by using a much larger dataset or by changing the algorithm 

## Features:

* Used scikit (A machine learning python library) to import an iris flower dataset which i split into data for testing and data for training the model. 
* Created a model that usses the K nearest neighbor algorithm along with the given training data (which consists of inputs and their corresponding type of flower). 
* Used the created model to predict the type of flower of the testing dataset.
* Used the metrics package to compare the prediction results with the actual results and received an accuracy of 97%.
* Used joblib to save the model into the file 'mlbrain'.
